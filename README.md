# Beyond
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/MisterJimson/beyond/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MisterJimson/beyond/actions)
This is an example app designed to demonstrate my approach to structuring a Flutter app.

I feel like most Flutter content that currently exists focuses on state management and I hope this can dig into other areas a bit more.

I am open to feedback, suggestions, and discussions on how this approach can be improved.

### Goals
- Clean
- Testable
- Consistent
- Don't reinvent the wheel, use libraries when appropriate
- Simple
